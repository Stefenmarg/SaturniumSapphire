### What is the purpose of this site?

This site will primarily function as a personal portfolio to highlight my projects and any scientific papers I may publish. Additionally, it will serve as a repository for my resume and other certifications, making them easily accessible to recruiters.

### How is this site built?

In the backend before the site is built into a static site we are using [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) that has recently joined [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) which infact is the service that I use for the social media icons on the footer. For bundling JavaScript code we are using [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) that bundles all the code in one file.
