## [2.0.1] - 2024-11-13

### This version has mostly to do with small features and bug-fixes

### Added

* A snippet in the head of the site with Google Analytics so I can see statistics and other metrics.
* The updated resume in the "About me" section of the site.
* A new (maybe temporary) favicon to the site generated by [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
* Now all the js files of the site are able to be modular since we have added [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that bundles them all up into one file. (Inportant for features down the road)
* Super secret feature for the upcoming holidays (let it snow).
* Snow engine is [snowStorm.js](http://schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm) whos license can be found [here](http://schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm/license.txt).
* Added code highlights fr many scripting languages.
* New section added to the site for TryHackMe events and posts.

### Changed
* The site now also shows the title of the tab that you are on.
* Thememanager and other exposed functions can now be accessed with the use of the window variable (ex: window.ThemeManager() or window.SyncCookies())

### Fixed
* All the functions of the ThemeManager (the cookie searching, theme setting, cookie saving) are now private, and only visisble to the functions that are called by the exposed functions of the ThemeManager.

### Removed
	
* The old resume in the "About me" section of the site.
